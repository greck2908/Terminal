These packages are redistributed inside this folder because they are not yet available on a public NuGet feed.

## Microsoft.UI.XAML
This package is a custom development build fork to help us light up tab support. It will eventually go onto the same public feed as the existing `Microsoft.UI.XAML` package that's currently available on NuGet.org

## TAEF.Redist.WLK
This package is vetted for public redistribution and release, but the TAEF team hasn't set up a public feed to consume it yet. If/when they do, we'll move to that.
